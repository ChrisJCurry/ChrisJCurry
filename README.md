### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<h3>I'm currently going to Boise Codeworks in Boise, ID! It's a 13-week full stack development course. RuneScape got me into programming when I was younger and I taught myself Java as that was the base language RuneScape used. Eventually through high school I found C# through a programming course for game development and fell in love! I use C# for Unity and am currently learning Unreal Engine  with C++. </h3>

<h3>The applications I've worked on uses technologies and languages like Vue3, Node.js, MongoDb, MySQL, JavaScript, and C#</h3>
